## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Vanilla CSS.


### What I learned

- I learned that a relatively simple card design can take a long time to get right. 
- I used a slightly different technique to create the card. I think it came out a lot better than my previous cards. 

### Continued development

I probably used too much CSS and I didn't refactor my code. It seems very inefficient. On my next project I will make sure to refactor it. It will be a part of the challenge.
